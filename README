A simple sudoku solver, written in Javascript.

This project was initially started as an exercise in improving the 
performance of a Javascript implementation of a sudoku solver, and 
having a first go at using HTML5 Web Workers.
However, the implementation solved sudokus in tiny fractions of a 
second with very little fiddling, making the exercise in efficiency 
almost pointless, and the use of Web Workers even more so.
In its current state, the Javascript to display the solution on the 
page after its calculation takes more time than the solving algorithm.

The interesting part of the project is in sudoku.js. The 'html' 
folder contains a web app using the library to solve sudokus 
entered into a HTML page.
